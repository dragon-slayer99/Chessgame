## 📖 How to Play

 1. Launch the game.
 
 2. Use your mouse to move the pieces.
     
    -**Instructions:**   
      - Green color square indicates that piece can move to that square.
      - Red color indicates that the move might result in chesk so the game won't allow the move.
      - If the king is in check you must move the king out of the check since the game won't allow any other piece to be moved.
      - The game indicates the turns of the player by displaying "white's turn" or "black's turn".
